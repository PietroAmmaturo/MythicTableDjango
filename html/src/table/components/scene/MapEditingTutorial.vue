        <h5>How to use the Map Editor</h5>
        <p>
            This mode allows you to quickly add and do minor edits to various images to create the map you desire. Start
            by either dragging and dropping images from your desktop into the open area, or clicking the upload panel at
            the bottom of your screen. You can do single images or many, which will then be added to your current map.
            <br />
            <br />
            By clicking an image you can select it, and then do basic transformations. Click again to deselect the
            image. Multiple images can be selected and deselected in this way. Selected image(s) can be dragged into
            your desired configuration. Use the corners to maintain the aspect ratio, but change scale. Use the central
            markers to stretch the image. The handle appearing off of the image allows for rotation. When multiple
            images are selected, they will be moved, scaled, stretched, or rotated in tandem.
            <br />
            <br />
            The top of the screen menu holds several additional manipulations for selected images. This includes moving
            images up or down in visual order and deleting any currently selected image. You can click the final button
            marked with an 'X' to exit this mode.
            <br />
            <br />
            To reopen this mode, click the edit pencil in your map library, and then click 'Edit Map' on the far left
            side.
